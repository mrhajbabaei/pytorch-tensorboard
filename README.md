# A repository to show how to use Tensorboard in PyTorch

In this project I am going to show you how to use Tensorboard as visualization tool in your PyTorch project. I used [this](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/vae) repository which is an official example of VAE network on PyTorch repository for doing so.
Please visit [my post](https://mrhajbabaei.github.io/pytorch-and-tensorboard/) on my [personal blog](https://mrhajbabaei.github.io/) for more information about this repository.
